# Report for Week #1

**Hours spent on the project:** ~15

## What I did
Figuring out the project idea was undoubtedly what I spent most of this time on. I browsed through the example topics over and over again, but could not find anything interesting. The spark came from a book I have been reading on and off: *Algorithms to Live By - The Computer Science of Human Decisions* by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. In the book, Christian and Griffiths go over common real-life applications for algorithms, ranging from how to select a secretary to how to sort your bookcase to how to organize the papers on your desk at work. One of their subjects is scheduling, and something about that intrigued me - so I ended up choosing that.

After deciding on the subject, I spent a few hours researching the common methods of solving single-machine scheduling problems while simultaneously figuring out the scope of the project and writing the project description. I also initialized this Git repository and the Gradle project.

## Difficulties
As I mentioned above, figuring out the subject was the most difficult part. Something I am still unsure of, however, is if the scope of the project is enough for this course. Should I have picked even more difficult algorithms? Is the problem I am attempting to solve in line with the goals of this course? I do feel like I will have my hands full creating a priority queue from scratch along with implementing the Moore-Hodgson Algorithm, even if EED and SPT are trivial problems to solve.

## What's next?
Begin work on implementing the basics:
- Creating and deleting tasks with a command-line interface
- First implementation of the Moore-Hodgson Algorithm using Java's built-in PriorityQueue class
